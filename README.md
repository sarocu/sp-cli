# sp-cli
The Superplus CLI is here to generate boilerplate statistical learning project assets. This includes generating basic project structure, creating new models, making tests and generating visualizations. 

## Building from Source
Build from source using the Rust's `cargo`:
```
cd sp
cargo build
```

Or build optimized releases using Make:
```bash
make clean
make release
```

## Create a new project
```bash
sp new project

# optionally with a cool name:
sp new project --name CoolStuff

cd CoolStuff

# add csv files to the project:
sp new csv -p ~/Downloads/AGNC.csv

# add a basic regression model:
sp new model --type simple_linear

# add some visualizations:
sp new viz
# output:
ðŸ“ˆ   Create a Bokeh Vizualization ðŸ“Š
Select a chart type to add::
  Basic Bar Chart
> Basic Line Chart
  Histogram
  Scatter Plot
  Boxplot
  Timeseries Chart
```

## Scaffold out a REST API Project
`sp` can generate boilerplate for a Flask API project, including Docker assets and Gunicorn/Supervisord configs. Just do `sp new api` and follow the prompts.

## Command Options
Superplus CLI generates code for a number of applications including microservice APIs, queues, machine learning and data science projects

| Command | Subcommand | Option | Description |
|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| new | project | `-n` or `--name` | Name of the project and directory |
| new | csv | `-p` or `--path` | Path to a CSV file you want to include in the project |
| new | viz | N/A | Kicks off the new visualization workflow |
| new | model | `-t` or `--type` | type of model you'd like to boilerplate for |
| new | api | N/A | Kicks off the  new Flask API workflow |

## Add to path:
After building with `cargo build`, add the `sp` executable to the path for use:
```bash
export PATH="~/sp-cli/sp/target/debug:$PATH"
```
